## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/) and it comes with npm bundled.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Magowntown/d8-airbnb.git
```

2. Change to the project directory

```bash
cd d8-airbnb
```

3. Install the required dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run serve
```

The development server will start, and you can view the template on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customization

To customize the template, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `src` directory.

- `src/index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure of the template
- `src/styles.css`: Contains the custom CSS styles for the template
- `src/main.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the template (if any)

## Build

To build the production version of the template, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` directory. You can now deploy these files to your preferred hosting platform.

## Deployment
